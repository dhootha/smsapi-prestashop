SmsApi export - Prestashop module
=============

This module is compatible with Prestashop 1.5+ (tested on 1.5.4.1).

This module gives you the ability to export Slovene mobile numbers of your customers so you can import them into SmsApi.

Numbers are exported in CSV format so you might need to save them as XLS before importing. The module also gives you the ability to group customers according to if they have bought any products in your store or not. Module filters for valid Slovene mobile numbers and formats them properly so they can be imported.
